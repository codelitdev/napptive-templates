# MongoDB

This application will deploy MongoDB's latest image.

## Connecting to the database

Please checkout [this](https://docs.napptive.com/FAQ.html#i-cannot-connect-to-my-app) guide to port forward the deployed application and connect to it using `mongosh`. Once, you have port-forwarded the application, run the following command.

```sh
mongosh -u root -p root
```
